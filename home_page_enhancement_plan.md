# Home Page Enhancement Plan

## Goal

Enhance the home page to provide quick access to key features and display a summary of recent health data.

## Plan

1.  **Modify the `HomePage` component:**
    *   Add a section to display a summary of recent health data. This section should include:
        *   Blood Pressure: Display the most recent blood pressure reading (e.g., 120/80 mmHg) and the date it was taken.
        *   Cholesterol Levels: Display the most recent cholesterol levels (e.g., LDL: 100 mg/dL, HDL: 50 mg/dL) and the date they were taken.
        *   Blood Sugar: Display the most recent blood sugar reading (e.g., 90 mg/dL) and the date it was taken.
        *   Upcoming Appointments: Display the date, time, and type of the next upcoming appointment (e.g., Doctor's Visit on June 15th at 2:00 PM).
        *   Medication Reminders: Display the names of medications that need to be taken today and the times they should be taken (e.g., Metformin at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM).
    *   Add links or buttons for the following key features:
        *   Report Analysis
        *   Test Recommendations
        *   Facility Search
        *   Health Assistant
    *   Style the links or buttons and the health data summary to make them visually appealing and easy to understand.
2.  **Implement placeholder data:**
    *   Implement placeholder data for the health data summary, using the specific health data points suggested above.
3.  **Ensure the links navigate to the correct pages:**
    *   Verify that the links or buttons correctly navigate to the corresponding pages in the application.
