# Smart Home Application Interface Design Plan

## Goal

Design a modern and intuitive smart home application interface that prioritizes user experience, visual appeal, and seamless device control.

## Plan

1.  **Clean Aesthetics:**
    *   Use a minimalist design with plenty of white space to create a clean and uncluttered look.
    *   Avoid unnecessary visual elements or distractions.
    *   Focus on simplicity and clarity.
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Use a calming and modern color palette consisting of:
        *   Primary: #66BB6A (Light Green)
        *   Secondary: #42A5F5 (Light Blue)
        *   Accent: #FFA726 (Orange)
        *   Neutral: #ECEFF1 (Very Light Gray)
        *   Text: #263238 (Very Dark Blue)
    *   Use a limited number of colors to avoid overwhelming the user.
    *   Ensure that the colors are accessible and provide sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments.
3.  **Typography:**
    *   Use **Roboto** as the primary font. Roboto is a modern and readable sans-serif font that is widely used on the web and mobile devices.
    *   Use appropriate font sizes and line heights to improve readability.
    *   Use different font weights and styles to create visual hierarchy.
4.  **Icons:**
    *   Use consistent and easily recognizable icons.
    *   Use icons that are appropriate for the task they represent.
    *   Ensure that the icons are visually consistent with the overall design.
    *   Consider using a consistent icon style (e.g., line icons, filled icons).
5.  **Implementation:**
    *   Modify the `src/App.css` file to implement the visual design elements described above.
    *   Consider creating a separate CSS file for the home page (`src/pages/HomePage.css`) to style the home page specifically.
